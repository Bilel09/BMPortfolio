Title: Bilel Mezhoud 
Description : Passionate about software development and data science, I hold a degree in applied mathematics and computer science from the Université du Québec à Trois-Rivières. As a specialist in Python, Java, and SQL, I have gained solid experience in artificial intelligence, particularly through an innovative research project that integrated AI and natural language processing for data classification, achieving exceptional performance that surpassed traditional methods. Additionally, I have developed GIS systems using ArcGIS for the City of Montreal, where I optimized green space management through geospatial integration and analysis, while designing dashboards for efficient information visualization.
